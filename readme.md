I struggled to deploy swagger docs to google cloud, so I separated them and deployed them to Render. Here you can access them: https://test-c1xh.onrender.com/docs/

I use free tier, so the server may take a while to start if accessed for the first time.

I couldn't find anyone having the same, or at least similar issue that I had. I added a screenshot of the error to project if you wanted to check it: error.png
